# PyBer Analysis Challenge 
  Perform exploratory analysis on rideshare data and create several types of visualizations to  help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability of underserved neighborhoods by comparing quantity and fare of rides in each city type.

   I have used Jupyter Notebook , Pandas and Matplotlib library for this analysis.
   
## Project Analysis
  Using Python Skills and the knowledge of Pandas, the summary DataFrame has been created of the ride-sharing data by city types namely: rural, suburban, urabn cities. 
  
#### Percentage of Total Rides by City Type

 The pie-chart shows that the ride count of Urban cities is significantly greater than the Sub-urban and Urban cities

#### Percentage of Total Drivers by City Type

 The below pie-chart shows that the there are there are few drivers in rural areas compared to much higher count in urban cities

#### Percentage of Total Fares by City Type

   Since there is a greater usage of Pyber in urban cities, the total fares are also higher than the suburban and rural cities.The figure shows that the majority of revenue occured in the urban cities


In terms of costs, it shows that the riders in rural cities pay on an average $10 more than riders in urban cities. The average fare per ride is about $35 in rural cities whereas, the urban cities average fare is around $25.

## Results : 
By Reviewing the summary, we can infer the below key findings :
   - Urban cities use PyBer services more than sub-urban and rural cities
   - Urban cities have higher ridership demand than the other 2 two cities
   - Urban cities have close to 5 times more drivers than sub-urban cities and 20 times more than rural cities
   - But the rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver. This could discourage the potential riders from using PyBer.
   - The data however doesn't include the travel distance, which could be a cause of ride ride costs in rural cities and low driver fares in urban cities.

### Total Fare by City Type Chart

The Total Fare by City Type chart demonstrates the total fares of each cities for period beteen Jan 2019 to April 2019.
The yellow trend shows how fares in uraban cities varied from $1600 to $2300 during the 5 month period. 
In Contrast, the blue trend shows, how fares in rural cities totaled around $300 from begining to end during the same period.  
The Orange trend shows how the total fares in suburban cities fall btween Urban and rural cities.

The chart also demonstrates, similar peaks almost during the same time for most of the cases. One most visible peak among all cities occured around the end of February 2019.

## Summary
 
  Based on the analysis and results, it show that there is a larger demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to sub-urban and rural cities. My business suggestion, would be to increase the number of drivers in rural areas .This ensures that there are enough drivers to meet ride demand since the rural cities average fare per ride and driver are much higher than suburban and urban cities. This can also indicate that the rural area  might be taking trips over a longer distance although it isnt mentioned directly. This can result in the drivers being occupied with current trips and loss in potential revenue when ther are peaks in business. 
  Also, it would be economical to reduce the number of drivers in urban cities if possible since out of the 2,405 drivers there were only 1,625 rides. Which means not every driver has at least one ride. Reducing the number of drivers will increase average fare per driver.
   Based on this extensive analysis and results, the PyBer CEO can now focus on addressing these disparities among all the city types which would help strengthen PyBer.
